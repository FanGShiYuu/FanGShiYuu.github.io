# About Me

<img src="/images/shiyufang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Shiyu Fang** (English: /ʃiː juː fæŋ/ SHEE-YOO FANG; Chinese: **房世玉**).

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the Department of Traffic Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Jian Sun](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jian-Sun-56) and [Prof. Peng Hang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peng-Hang-3). My research interests lie in the intersection of decision-making and motion planning for autonomous vehicles, game theory, intelligent transportation systems, and human behavior under interaction.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *2111219[at]tongji[dot]edu[dot]cn*
