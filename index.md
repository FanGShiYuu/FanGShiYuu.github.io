# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Shiyu Fang** (English: / ÉiÀê juÀê f√¶≈ã/ SHEE-YOO FANG; Chinese: **Êàø‰∏ñÁéâ**).

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the Department of Traffic Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Jian Sun](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jian-Sun-56) and [Prof. Peng Hang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peng-Hang-3). My research interests lie in the intersection of decision making and motion planning for autonomous vehicles, game theory, intelligent transportation systems, and human behavior under interation.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *2111219[at]tongji[dot]edu[dot]cn*
