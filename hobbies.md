## Basketball

<br>Basketball, to me, is an immersive experience that engages my entire being. Each shot, each dribble, presents both challenge and joy. On the court, I find release from stress and worries, fully absorbed in the game, basking in its calming effect.

<br>Yet, beyond the personal satisfaction, basketball is a team sportâ€”a collective effort toward victory. We collaborate, synchronize, striving together. This camaraderie warms my heart; through our shared struggle, deep friendships are forged.

<br>Over the past three years, my teammates and I have clinched the championship of the Tongji University School of Transportation Engineering basketball tournament three times in a row. Through this journey, I've evolved into a court leader, guiding our progression and growth. Even as friends graduate and move on, the sweat we shed on the court will forever moisten the ground, and these cherished memories will remain etched in our hearts.

## Frisbee

<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].
